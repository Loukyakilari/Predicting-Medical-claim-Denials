                        Healthcare organizations face increasing pressure to maintain financial stability while ensuring high-quality patient care. 
                        One of the critical challenges in revenue cycle management is medical claims denial, which significantly affects an organization’s 
                        financial performance. Studies indicate that denied claims account for approximately 5–10% of lost revenue,
                         with the cost of appealing a single claim ranging between $25 and $117 (Change Healthcare Revenue Cycle Denials Index, 2023). 
                         For organizations handling high volumes of claims, these costs can accumulate rapidly — for example, appealing 100 denials per 
                         month can lead to additional expenses of $2,500 to $11,700, further straining resources. Beyond direct financial losses, 
                         claim denials introduce substantial administrative burdens, disrupt cash flow, delay payments, and may lead to reduced
                          patient satisfaction due to extended billing cycles and unresolved claims. Addressing claim denials effectively requires
                           proactive strategies and data-driven tools that can help identify issues before claims are submitted.

                     <p>
                      This project explores how machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to healthcare claim data to predict whether a claim is 
                      likely to be approved or denied. Denials are often caused by factors such as incomplete documentation, coding errors, eligibility 
                      issues, and payer policy mismatches. By building a predictive model that analyzes claim details, organizations can identify 
                      potential denials early and take corrective action to minimize revenue loss.

                    <p>Due to the sensitive nature of real-world healthcare data and privacy regulations such as HIPAA, synthetic claims
                       data was generated for this project. The dataset was designed to mimic realistic patterns in medical claims, 
                       including various providers, specialties, procedure codes, diagnosis codes, insurance providers, 
                       and known denial reasons.Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated on this dataset to predict not only the claim 
                      outcome (approved/denied) but also to classify the likely reason for denial in the event of a predicted rejection.</p>

              

              
              <p>The trained machine learning models were integrated into this web application using Flask. The application allows
                 users to upload a file containing multiple healthcare claims and receive batch predictions for each claim. 
                 The output provides the predicted claim status (approved or denied), and for denied claims, the likely reason 
                 for denial. This tool demonstrates how predictive analytics can assist healthcare revenue cycle teams in identifying
                  high-risk claims before submission and taking corrective actions to reduce denial rates.</p>
