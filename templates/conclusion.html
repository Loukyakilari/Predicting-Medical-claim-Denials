  <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    This project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to predict medical claim denials before submission, 
    using a synthetic dataset of 10,000 medical claims. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), key patterns and trends were uncovered 
    across denial rates, operational areas, and medical specialties.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated for claim status prediction, with the Random Forest classifier achieving the best F1-score 
    and selected as the final model. For denial reason classification, grouped denial categories were used to improve predictive accuracy, with XGBoost 
    emerging as the top-performing model.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    The F1-score was prioritized as the evaluation metric due to the class imbalance present in the data, ensuring the models could accurately capture both 
    Approved and Denied claims while reducing false positives. Both models were deployed within an interactive web interface to support healthcare providers 
    in proactively managing claim denials.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    Overall, this project demonstrates how data-driven tools can be used to enhance revenue cycle management in healthcare settings, improving efficiency 
    and reducing financial risk associated with claim denials.
